		"q_subdomain" : null,
		"explanation" : "The real power of compound interest comes into picture only when the interest is compounded more frequently (such as daily or monthly) instead of over long intervals (yearly). And this is usually not the case - most compound interest schemes are offered over longer intervals. Hence, it is much desirable to opt for simple interest schemes for short term goals since then it wouldn't make much sense to have interest compounded then."
